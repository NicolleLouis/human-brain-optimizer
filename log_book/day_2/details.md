# Day 2

Less funny math improvements today but a big archi change. Set up the whole training system.
It accepts any number of config and will try all the possible combination. 
The first training was on the brain action and shifting it from a random value to an ```f(x) = a*x+ b```. 

After training the result is: b = 0, a = 25. Which is interesting. Was quite surprised by the 0 value. The "a = 0" cases
were the worst by far, which is reassuring. 

The new result is: 

Average lifespan: **74 hours**

This improved function improved the result from 45 to 74. which is a 60% increase. Which is quite drastic :)

Also, it shifted the death origin away from food issues:
```{"food": 6742, "energy": 2868, "multiple": 390}```
